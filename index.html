    <h1>Important Concepts </h1>
    <h3> How the Web Works </h3>    
<p> The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request to a server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. <a href="www.udacity.com">This video</a> does a good job of explaining.</p>
      </div>    
       <h3>HTML</h3>    
  <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup </em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="www.udacity.com">This video gives</a> a good overview.</p>

  <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
    <p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. This video explains the distinction well.</p>

<h3>Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>

  <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
